- Note: only https-level authorization, no SSH-level cloning
- Uses DagsHub storage for storing models, data
- Some issue with DVC requires me to downgrade to dvc==2.3.0

- Some issue installing the particular version of Numpy
- key thing: Track Data Files with DVC, Track code with Git
- Can render tabular data within the DagsHub UI
- Tracking Experiments:
    -- DagsHub Logger save model metrics from experiments as .csv files, and
        saves parameters as .yaml files
    -- DagsHub Logger looks to be agnostic to the list of hyperparameters
        established for your model
    -- Model experiment is tied to a commit
- Testing a new hypothesis
    -- Creating a new benchmark model to compare is typically represented as a
        new branch
- Question:
    -- Does DVC support Model and Data Storage Management on S3 Buckets?
        --- Yes it does!
        --- https://dagshub.com/docs/integration_guide/set_up_remote_storage_for_data_and_models/
    -- What are the storage limits of DagsHub Storage?
    -- What are these added blue columns to the experiment set?
- Potential Issues to raise on DagsHub repo:
    -- issue with numpy dependency in the tutorial
